# AEDA1718

AEDA (Algorythims and Data Structures in C++) is a second grade subject of FEUP's computer engineering course, MIEIC. In this repository I'll maintain my resolutions of exercices solved in its practical classes and tested using the CUTE plugin, mainly so other students can compare their answers.

# Folder Meaning

Each folder represents a class and cointains all files needed to run the code. Here I'll give a quick explanation of what they mean, and update this section as necessary.

- TP1: Implementation of class ParqueEstacionamento (parking lot) - using classes, const members, references, etc.
- TP2: Implementation of class Zoo and related classes as well - using heritance, polymorphism, pointers, static members, etc. NOTE: the text file should be in your project's root folder, not src.
- TP3: Implementation of class Grafo - using templates, exceptions, streams, etc.
- TP5: Working with a modified version of ParqueEstacionamento - using sort and search algorithms, exceptions, overloading operators, etc.
- CI1-PP-2016: Resolution of the first exam of 2016. 
- CI1-PP-2015: Resolution of the first exam of 2015.
- CI1-PP-2013: Resolution of the first exam of 2013.
- TP6: Working with lists.
- TP7: Working with stacks and queues.
- CI2-PP-2016: Resolution of the second exam of 2016. 
- CI3-PP-2014: Resolution of the third exam of 2014. 
- CI3-PP-2013: Resolution of the third exam of 2013. 

# Usage

To run and test these files you'll need to have Eclipse installed along with CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) and CUTE.
- Create a new C++ CUTE project, using an adequate compiler for your OS, and on the next screen select “Copy Boost headers into Project”.
 - Import your desired files into the project's src folder.
 - Build project.
 - Select Run Configurations - CUTE test, and run.

Test results should now appear on the bottom tab.

IMPORTANT: Before building, make sure that Eclipse is using the latest version of C++ (C++11), otherwise you might not be able to run my code. You can find tutorials on stackoverflow! 

# Note

If you happen to come across this repository, please take into consideration that I'm pretty much a beginner when it comes to programming. As stated above, this repository's only goal is to share my code with my fellow students and get accostumed to this platform, nothing else. However, if you have any suggestion when it comes to my structure, coding style, etc, feel free to contact me!
